This backend is developed and maintained by our team (Amine, Hamza, and Badreddine), working together to deliver robust and scalable solutions for modern e-commerce applications.

### Note :
### If you use heroku as your backend hosting's choice, everytime you want to commit use heroku's way :

- git add .
- git commit -am "make it better"
- git push heroku master

### When set it up in cloudflare, you need to set the SSL till flexible. So your AWS Settings could come in.
